@1000  = ~Imoen is gone!

As soon as we set foot onto Brynnlaw, Imoen was taken by what seemed to be a Cowled Wizard! If Irenicus had a hand in this I can only guess what horrors he has prepared for her. But is it really his doing? I stand helpless and bereft of my friend. All I can do is search for a way into the Asylum, as quickly as possible, to see what I will find...~

@1001  = %I... I can go? Er, I don't have any gold... But I have this girdle... Surely a *very* powerful item, yes?%
@1002  = %Would you accept this instead? (And I get rid of it at last...)%
@1003  = %Indeed, this will do. We will remove it from you.%
@1004  = %Oh! It's... er, really a powerful item? (cough)%
@1005  = %Fools! You have no idea what this is about. Fine, no matter. Let her go. I will get back to them both, when the time is right.%
@1006  = %But not without making sure you will be able to, little one - even without the girdle I gave you.%
@1007  = %He is casting a spell, here, inside the building and in front of all of us! Take him away already!%
@1008  = %The girl could walk free, if she pays the penalty.%
@1009  = %Who are you and what is this about?%
@1010  = %Hush. You are but a substitute, but you will do - for now.%
@1011  = %Imprisoned Mage%


@1012  = ~Where... where am I? How did I get here?!~


@1013  = ~The gold was not important, Edwin. We have to help <CHARNAME> locate this Irenicus person.~
@1014  = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't need to tell you how much I hate this. This all scares me. Once we reach our goal we must never associate with these people again.~
@1015  = ~Our host may have a murky past, but this task benefits us both. We will earn access to Irenicus, and keep the balance here. The nature of the street to protect.~
@1016  = ~As much as I ramble on at the drop of a hat, I would think it wiser to find this Irenicus with all haste. It's like my uncle Gummo use to say, "Blah blah blah," he'd say, and we'd be like "Uncle Gummo, we've got things to do," and he'd just continue with "But just one more story. Just one more, blah blah."~
@1017  = ~My task must not go unfinished. Please, Keldorn, serve until we've defeated Irenicus.~
@1018  = ~And that would accomplish what? Death on a grand scale, and make our task all the harder. Pursuing our main goal must come first.~
@1019  = ~Actually Keldorn, I've been thinking... The quest against Irenicus is my own and I have no right to force it upon a good friend against his will... You need to be here with your family.~ 
@1020  = ~I felt... I felt like a husband again, like a father. It was good, <CHARNAME>. Very good... Now let us defeat this Irenicus, that I might return here all the sooner.~ 
@1021  = ~Fine, then. Free it is. So long as we get a portion of the treasure.~
@1022  = ~You'd have bought a trip to the graveyard if you had spent the money we needed to chase that mage! Minsc and Boo would see to that!~
@1023  = ~I was wondering... is there anything you can tell me about this wizard, Irenicus? Or the Cowled Wizards?~
@1024  = ~I cannot confirm anything else about the deal, except to confirm that yes... we can look into the location of this Irenicus.~
@1025  = ~I have paid out a huge amount of gold; tell me how I can find Irenicus.~ 
@1026  = ~It sounds good, though I must see to getting to Irenicus. What do you propose as a deal?~ 
@1027  = ~I will do nothing of the sort! I demand you tell me where Irenicus is! I paid!~ 
@1028  = ~You may not care about my people, <CHARNAME>, but I do. They deserve protection, and in fact, if they do not get it, you will not get our help.~ 
@1029  = ~When you have destroyed their evil, return to me and I will fulfill our bargain. Do this job well and you may be with those you seek by the morning. What say you?~ 
@1030  = ~He must be found, and that is best facilitated by helping you find him - obviously.~ 
@1031  = ~Once on the island you will be on your own to contend with the asylum defenses and the pirates that run the place. Fight the pirates if you wish. Kill Irenicus if you can.~ 
@1032  = ~Now, I know you are eager to set off after Irenicus, and I assure you that the time will come soon. It takes time to allocate the funds however.~  
@1033  = ~And they are the block that prevents your pursuit of Irenicus. Trust in me, <CHARNAME>, you will not regret it.~ 
@1034  = ~We thought you could lead us to him, and you can. You seek Irenicus, and we seek answers - both will be found together.~  
@1035  = ~I would offer an alternative. I know your friend Imoen came back to you and you might think both of you are safe. But you will not be as long as Irenicus is out there. I would help you find him for...oh... 15,000 gold? It is a sizeable amount less than the Shadow Thieves have asked and, coincidentally, it is what you have now.~ 
@1036  = ~And you will help me find Irenicus for 15000? I still wonder why you would do this.~  
@1037  = ~When will you help me find Irenicus? I have already paid you what you asked!~  
@1038  = ~I have done much for you. When will you help me with Irenicus?~  
@1039  = ~I have done everything you have asked. When will you help me with Irenicus?~  
@1040  = ~I have tried to do as you have asked. When will you help me find Irenicus?~  
@1041  = ~You would not want the path blocked by Shadow Thieves, would you? The task at hand will ensure safe passage for you and all that travel with you. Let's get to it then.~ 
@1042  = ~You seek Irenicus, the one who would give you power. I am prepared to give you his location, and the means with which to reach him.~ 
@1043  = ~Of course you saw the outcome of that battle, with him spirited away - and some of your own companions, temporarily. You seek Irenicus, as well as I seek him. Both of us could benefit by his return.~  
@1044  = ~I will do what I must. I make no promise for the safety of this Irenicus.~
@1045  = ~I ask much, that is true, but this will benefit us both. You give him to me, and I tell you what he has learned about you. Think of your potential. Think of what you hold dear.~ 
@1046  = ~Perhaps he does, and perhaps he will get it. What happens is entirely dependent on your willingness to help. Do it for yourself. Do it for your power!~ 
@1047  = ~It will not interfere. You will reach Irenicus with ease, for he is brought to a horrible place designed to hold the strong willed. A place the Cowled Wizards bring all they call "deviants".~ 
@1048  = ~Return quickly to me. The longer you wait, the more distant Irenicus shall become. For a deviant, a stay in Spellhold is not a gentle one. Not even for one as powerful as Irenicus...~ 
@1049  = ~First I would like to know where Irenicus is.~ 
@1050  = ~I am leery of working for the people who took my friend Imoen with them without good reason. Tell me where Irenicus is, first.~ 
@1051  = ~Irenicus?  Ah... the arrested wizard. I do not have such inconsequential information on me, so put aside such demands.~
@1052  = ~I will not put it aside. Either you tell me where Irenicus is or you shall not receive my assistance.~
@1053  = ~Perhaps if you tell me of Irenicus's location it will convince me to agree.~
@1054  = ~You said you could look into Irenicus's location for me if I did as you asked, and I have done it.~
@1055  = ~I have done as you asked and proven myself to you... now, I want to know what you've done with Irenicus.~
@1056  = ~Members of your order arrested someone I seek, Irenicus. I want to know where he is before I agree to do anything.~
@1057  = ~Perhaps. Members of your order, however, arrested someone I seek: Irenicus.  I would know where he is, first.~
@1058  = ~I wish to know something. Members of your order arrested someone I seek: Irenicus. I would know where he is before I agree to anything.~
@1059  = ~Your order arrested someone I seek: Irenicus. Tell me where he is and I might consider your task.~
@1060  = ~Irenicus?  Ah... the arrested wizard. I do not have such inconsequential information on me. You must put such demands aside.~
@1061  = ~This Irenicus... turned out to be a powerful wizard. He has caused... problems since his capture, striking fear into the heart of my order.~
@1062  = ~The Cowled Wizards will not give away any information until the issue is resolved, so in effect I can tell you nothing.~
@1063  = ~And even had this not occurred, you could not get to him, fool. He broke the law, and it is final. The Cowled Wizards do not give second chances.~
@1064  = ~The Cowled Wizards? They are the ones that arrested Irenicus. I would be very interested in speaking to them about that.~
@1065  = ~I do not know anything about that. I represent one of the wizards, as I said, a Master Tolgerias. Perhaps you could speak to him of this Irenicus?~
@1066  = ~And what if I said I wished to know the whereabouts of Irenicus? Might your wizard see his way to doing that?~
@1067  = ~You speak of trust when you are the ones that took Irenicus before I could have my revenge? Tell me where he is, then we will talk.~
@1068  = ~Irenicus? I don't know the name. This is a large city, and the Cowled Wizards have many subdivisions and such. Taken because of unauthorized magic use?~
@1069  = ~I will inquire to my superiors about him if you wish. Until then, I would advise that you act in accordance with this agreement.~
@1070  = ~Have you discovered anything about the whereabouts of Irenicus? I must know.~
@1071  = ~And before you ask, no, I have not learned anything new about your Irenicus friend. I have not forgotten. You must be patient.~
@1072  = ~That's it? You've nothing else for me? What about Irenicus's whereabouts?~
@1073  = ~And before you ask, no, I have no information about your friend Irenicus. I will ask again, because I know you will pester me.~
@1074  = ~Regardless, I have some news of this Irenicus. I said I would tell you what I could, and since you have performed well, I think I owe you that much.~
@1075  = ~He was taken into custody, that much you know. He proved too unruly for simple incarceration.~
@1076  = ~He is no longer in the city. I could get nothing further from my superiors, and I expect that asking for more would yield a harsh response.~
@1077  = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I informed Aran Linvail of the events on the docks, and he is even more concerned than before.  His next task for me is to go to the top floor of the Five Flagons Inn in the Bridge District... there I will find two Shadow Thieves named Jaylos and Caehan who plan to defect to the rival guild.

Perhaps I can pretend to be another recruit, just as they are. If all goes as planned I might even fool their contact as well. Hopefully I will get the location of the rival guild's headquarters and then Aran can stop them from disrupting his people. Then we can get to the business of finding Irenicus. He seems sincere in this.~
@1078  = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I have completed the tasks Aran Linvail set out for me, and at last the location of Irenicus has been revealed.  This did not come, mind you, without some revelations.

The Shadow Thieves have been interested in me from the beginning. They were aware of my capture, but thought it nothing more than a simple kidnapping and none of their business. However, soon after that Bodhi appeared and their members started disappearing. They thought another guild was converting them, making a bid for control of the city's underground, and directed an attack against what they thought was the guild headquarters, Irenicus' dungeon below Waukeen's. 

They were totally unprepared for how strong Irenicus was. After the battle they set their sights on me, because I was the only thing that came out of that dungeon alive. Since I was of such interest to Irenicus they needed to know what I was up to. Once they realized that Irenicus was a threat to us both, they sought to aid me, while also aiding themselves. Their intentions were good, despite their selfish motive.

They believe that Irenicus is still very much a threat. He has been taken to an island asylum called Spellhold where mages are imprisoned and studied. And yet it sounds doubtful that Irenicus has been so easily overcome. Bodhi and her rival guild are tied to him in some manner...and his purpose in studying both myself and Imoen is still unknown.

Irenicus still remains in that place, however. The Shadow Thieves have arranged a ship to take me to the isle at no small expense, hoping in that I might rid them of their problem, as well.  Whatever happens, I am sure my biggest challenge yet awaits me on this isle.~
@1079  = ~Bodhi's offer rejected.

Bodhi offered to let me join her guild, the one that has been warring with the Shadow Thieves.  She told me that my current employers were the Shadow Thieves, and that they could not be trusted. She also offered to help me find Irenicus, and at a significantly cheaper price than the Thieves. She hinted that my duties under her would be very bloody indeed. 

I didn't think I could trust her, and I didn't want to throw away what I have done so far.  I turned her down, and now she is an enemy. She let me leave peacefully, accepting my decision, but stated quite matter-of-factly that we would meet again on less friendly terms.~
@1080  = ~Perform Bodhi's tasks to receive her aid.

Bodhi told me much today...but most importantly that she has booked passage to the island asylum where ...presumably... Irenicus is being held.  I am to return to her as soon as I am ready to leave on the ship.~
@1081  = ~Bodhi keeps her side of the bargain.

Bodhi agreed to fulfill our bargain, though there were some additional concerns she revealed.
According to Bodhi, Irenicus captured me because he had discovered my nature as a child of Bhaal, and he was attempting to 'aid' my development, though his methods were indistinguishable from torture. The Shadow Thieves attacked Irenicus before I could be told any of this, and I escaped as he was incarcerated.

Bodhi also told me that she is essentially Irenicus' sister, and that her reason for helping me is that she wishes to free the wizard from the place he has been sent to, a dread asylum for magic-users called Spellhold. Bodhi does this not out of any familial attachment, but rather because she requires Irenicus for her own purposes. As added incentive she offers to reveal whatever Irenicus learned about me. 

The asylum is on an island under its own rule, and Bodhi used the gold I gave her to book passage for me.  There I will try to find a way into Spellhold to confront Irenicus...and, Bodhi hopes, free him at the same time.~
@1082  = ~Meet with Tolgerias the Cowled Wizard.

Tolgerias, the Cowled Wizard in the government building, has promised to find some information out on Irenicus if I perform the service that he is asking of me.~

@1083 = ~Yeah, that's exactly *why* I was...~

@1084 = ~Collect the fee for Gaelan Bayle.

Gaelan Bayle will connect me with a group who will aid in finding Irenicus, but the price is 20,000 gp! A steep cost, but he did mention that it entailed crossing the Cowled Wizards, not something to be done lightly. Once I have the 20,000 gp, I am to speak to him again.~
@1085 = ~Perform Bodhi's tasks to receive her aid.

I have agreed to work for Bodhi. She is the head of the 'rival guild' that is facing off against the Shadow Thieves. She required far less coin than my current employers did. I am also to perform several services in undermining the Shadow Thieves, and once these are done I will have her full aid in finding Irenicus. These services may be bloody and harsh.

Doing this means that the Shadow Thieves are now my enemies, and according to Bodhi they will already know that I have turned against them. Fair enough. My first mission is to go down to the docks in the Docks District and find a shipment that is being guarded by Shadow Thieves.  Once I obtain the shipment, I am to return to the crypts below in the Graveyard District and give it to Bodhi.

Bodhi also mentions that despite its grim appearance, the crypts are a safe place to rest if I need it.~
@1086 = ~Chapter 4

Now that I have completed the tasks that Bodhi set out for me, which included the disruption of the Shadow Thieves and the assassination of the Shadowmaster, Aran Linvail himself, she has made several things quite a bit clearer.

Irenicus, the mage who kidnapped me, is Bodhi's brother. She says she did not support his abduction of me, which was apparently done because I am a Child of Bhaal. What Imoen and I perceived as torture was actually the mage trying to discover and activate "my true potential"... whether I wished to or not.
Bodhi wants to find her brother and gain access to the knowledge that he possesses, and for my aid she will turn over whatever information he has about me. She will accompany me beyond this point, as Irenicus is held in a fortress asylum called Spellhold on a remote island far from Amn. The gold I gave her has been used to book passage with a privateer named Saemon Havarian.  Once I am at the island I will need to find a way into the asylum... although I do not know how Bodhi will participate, herself. Soon I will have the answers I seek...~
@1087 = ~Chapter 4

I have completed the tasks that Aran Linvail set out for me, including destroying the rival guild that Bodhi had set up and forcing the vampire herself to flight, and now the Shadowmaster has enlightened me about several things.

The Shadow Thieves were the ones who attacked Irenicus in the dungeon that I awoke in. They had heard about my kidnapping, but not thought much of it... but then Bodhi's guild appeared and many of the Shadow Thieves began to disappear. They managed to track down Irenicus' dungeon and linked it to Bodhi... and I was witness to their subsequent disastrous assault.
Aran told me that Irenicus was taken to an island asylum for mages called Spellhold. The gold I supplied was used to book passage to the isle, and it is there that I will find the answers I seek. Aran warns me, though, that the asylum is a veritable fortress meant to contain insane wizards and other 'deviants'... and even gaining entry will be a feat unto itself. Regardless, passage with a privateer named Saemon Havarian has been booked and I am on my way...~
@1088 = ~Chapter 3

Throughout my time in Athkatla and my adventures in and around the city, I have seen hints of some great struggle between the Shadow Thieves and some other source. This other source approached me in the form of Bodhi... a woman of great power and evil, rivalling her ambition.  She revealed the nature of my benefactors under Gaelan Bayle to be none other than the Shadow Thieves themselves, and offered to give me the same help that they did... but at a far lesser price.

I have accepted Bodhi's offer and she has taken me into her confidence, for now. The true nature of her motivations has yet to be revealed, but it's obvious that Bodhi is on the winning side of this city-wide conflict. As to the gold I have given her for her aid... I have the feeling that it is just the beginning of the final price I will eventually have to pay.  But I will have my answers... I will find Irenicus.~
@1089 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I have defeated the rival guild, full of vampires as it was, and have faced Bodhi. She seemed to be judging me in some manner before she left in gaseous form. All that remains now is to return to Aran and tell him that the guild is gone, even if their leader remains unkilled. I will have questions for him as well.

One more troubling thing... Bodhi knew. She knew I am a child of Bhaal.~
@1090 = ~I can't. I must raise gold so the Shadow Thieves will aid me in finding Irenicus.~
@1091 = ~I trust you will waste no more time here? The ship awaits. Irenicus awaits.~
@1092 = ~What do you know of Irenicus!~
@1093 = ~And rest assured, I will help you find Irenicus, but not just for your reasons. I have an interest in him myself.~
@1094 = ~You must bear this as one of the additional conditions. I offer much, and expect much in return. Irenicus will be our joint goal in time.~
@1095 = ~15,000 is a lot, but I will compensate you well for it. You will ultimately have a lot of power, and a few magical trinkets too.~
@1096 = ~That is why I am asking politely. Why did you attack Irenicus? It was that fight that took Imoen from me, luckily not for very long.~
@1097 = ~We must take partial responsibility for your temporary loss of Imoen, but our chief concern was Irenicus at the time. We still don't know why he killed our guild members.~
@1098 = ~Well my point is that we should stop talking and fetching and try and find this Irenicus.~
@1099 = ~He... he wants us to steal from a temple?  Even from Talos, it still creeps me out.  Just... just how far will we sink to search for this Irenicus, <CHARNAME>?~
@1100 = ~Very well. I need to gather a large amount of gold to persue a foe, so I'll join you.~
@1101 = ~I'm searching for someone who has been taken by the Cowled Wizards... do you know anything about this?~
@1102 = ~Mmm. Is this the person who was taken in at the same time as your friend?~
@1103 = ~Yes, his name is Irenicus.~
@1104 = ~This man, Irenicus, is extremely powerful... the Cowled Wizards have likely bitten off far more than they can chew by taking him captive.~
@1105 = ~Our sources say the wizards are terrified of his power. Where this Irenicus might be, however, I do not know.~
@1106 = ~Someone I am looking for has been taken by the Cowled Wizards. Do you know where they keep their prisoners?~
@1107 = ~I must gather a large amount of gold to persue a foe of mine, so any reward you could offer would be appreciated.~
@1108 = ~I do need the gold, even if only to persue a very dangerous man.~
@1109 = ~I am searching for a mage named Irenicus who is being held by the Cowled Wizards. Do you know anything of them?~ 
@1110 = ~They act for the Council, but they do as they wish. We do not associate with them at all, so I know little else. I do not know what happened to that mage you seek.~ 
@1111 =  ~Pfeh! If that mage is a captive of the cowled ones there is little point in searching. The wizards have many secrets and they guard them all jealously.~
@1112 = ~I will take your gold, as I have unfinished business with that wizard. No other reason.~
@1113 = ~I may do this, but I am gathering a large amount of gold to persue a foe and would need a reward.~
@1114 = ~I will find him! I will find this Irenicus!~
@1115 = ~But we both seek Irenicus. Should we not work together?~
@1116 = ~Irenicus allowed himself to be overcome in his rage. He has recovered, and is no one's prisoner. Your Imoen is not as strong, though I am told she has... potential.~
@1117 = ~There is much to learn about you... and Imoen as well. Battle will be my laboratory. Come, let us both learn a thing or two.~
@1118 = ~Perhaps, but games can be deadly serious, especially when I keep the rules to myself. Fight on, and seek access to Irenicus; I have seen what I came to see.~
@1119 = ~Oh, I am not crawling away for fear of your wrath. By all means, coddle, develop and direct it. Fight on, and seek a way to reach Irenicus; I have seen what I came to see.~
@1120 = ~I am looking for someone who has been taken captive by the Cowled Wizards... do you know where they keep their prisoners?~
@1121 = ~I have a question... I am looking for someone who has been taken captive by the Cowled Wizards. Do you know where they keep their prisoners?~
@1122 = ~If you cannot convince the wizards to return this person, than your quest may be hopeless. But do not give up... the information you seek must exist.~
@1123 = ~No, actually. I am looking for someone who has been taken captive by the Cowled Wizards.  Do you know where they keep their prisoners, maybe?~
@1124 = ~I am looking for someone who has been taken captive by the Cowled Wizards... do you know where they might keep their prisoners?~
@1125 = ~I am looking for someone who has been taken captive by the Cowled Wizards... do you know where they might keep their prisoners, maybe?~
@1126 = ~But even if you did know, how in Arvoreen's name would you get there? The Cowled Wizards don't take intrusion lightly. Sorry about your friend, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@1127 = ~You must hear things... Someone I am looking for has been taken captive by the Cowled Wizards.  Do you know where they keep their prisoners?~
@1128 = ~I am searching for someone who was taken by the Cowled Wizards. Do you know of them?~
@1129 = ~But that is probably not news to you. If you seek a meeting with the one they took, I doubt they will hand him over gladly. You will need to operate against them.~
@1130 = ~I'm wondering something first. I need gold to persue a foe... is there a reward for capturing this murderer?~
@1131 = ~You're a Cowled Wizard? Perhaps you could tell me where the Cowled Wizards keep their prisoners. Someone of interest to me is being held.~
@1132 = ~I was wondering... do you know anything of the Cowled Wizards? Someone I am interested in is being held by them.~
@1133 = ~Then you're unlikely to find this person. The Cowled Wizards don't give anything up, and nobody knows where to find them... except those who can't talk.~
@1134 = ~Maria, this is <CHARNAME>. We are searching for a powerful mage, who-  ~
@1135 = ~And when the mighty mage is found...?~
@1136 = ~Someone of interest to me has been imprisoned by the Cowled Wizards. Do you know, perhaps, where they might have taken him?~
@1137 = ~I am looking for someone who's been imprisoned by the Cowled Wizards. Any idea where that prison might be?~
@1138 = ~Too bad stories like those don't give out specifics, eh? Like coordinates or names.  Best of luck, though, in tracking down your friend. You'll need it.~
@1139 = ~Someone I am looking for has been taken by the Cowled Wizards... do you have any information on them?~
@1140 = ~Their vigilance is likely just to eliminate competition, and they keep the location of their prisoners very secret. Wherever the person you seek is, no one will find them.~
@1141 = ~What is it worth? I need to save up enough coin to search for someone being held by the Cowled Wizards.~
@1142 = ~Is there a reward? I need to gather coin to search for someone being imprisoned by the Cowled Wizards, you see.~
@1143 = ~Suppose I decide to help you. I need to gather coin to search for someone being held by the Cowled Wizards... is there a reward involved?~
@1144 = ~I'm searching for someone who has been captured by the Cowled Wizards... do you know anything of them?~
@1145 = ~I need to gather a large amount of gold to persue a foe, so I would be interested in a reward.~
@1146 = ~I see. I need to gather a large amount of gold to persue a foe, however, so I would be interested in some kind of reward.~
@1147 = ~I need to collect a large amount of gold to persue a foe, so any reward you could offer would be appreciated.~
@1148 = ~I need a large amount of gold to persue a foe, so I would like to know what reward you are offering, first.~
@1149 = ~Any ideas on how I might gather a lot of coin? I need it to get to someone who was taken by the Cowled Wizards.~
@1150 = ~Someone I am searching for has been taken by the Cowled Wizards, and I need to find out where they bring their prisoners. Do you know anything about that?~
@1151 = ~We are looking for someone who has been taken captive by the Cowled Wizards. Perhaps you've heard where they keep their prisoners?~
@1152 = ~Someone of interest has been imprisoned by the Cowled Wizards... do you have any idea where their prisoners would be kept?~
@1153 = ~I need to collect a large amount of coin to persue a foe... might there be a reward if I did this task for you?~
@1154 = ~I need to collect a large amount of gold to persue a foe... so I want to know if there is a reward, first.~

@1159 = ~Well... I need to gather coin to persue someone that's been imprisoned by the Cowled Wizards. Is there a reward, perhaps?~
@1160 = ~Perhaps, if there's a reward involved. I need to gather coin to persue someone that's been imprisoned by the Cowled Wizards.~
