@144  = ~[female refugee]That's the lamest excuse I ever heard. In times like these, noone would just give away a ring. No - you'll get a mouthful later, you hear me? Hiding such a ring from me! Can you believe it...~

@146  = ~[female refugee]I don't know where it came from, but it was in my pocket! This gem is worth a fortune. I can book a carriage to Waterdeep!~

@152  = ~[male refugee]...well aware, but that you would go to such measures is beyond my imagination. Placing a gem into my pillow so *I* would be suspected of thieving and kicked out of camp! How low can one fall!~
@153  = ~[Imoen]Aw!... No, that's not what...~
@154  = ~[male refugee]What? I did no such thing! Why would I give a gem to *you* just to get you out of this camp. Had I such a gem, I would use it for myself! ...Wait - yes, of course it's *my* gem! Give me *my* gem back!~
@155  = ~[male refugee]No way, you liar! You just said it's not yours! So it's mine - I found it!~
@156  = ~[male refugee]No! Give me the gem! Give it to me!~
@157  = ~[male refugee]...I swear I don't know where they are coming from. Please believe me!~
@158  = ~[male refugee]Ah, I wanted to hand these gems in to Sir Rayphus, but he doesn't seem to be available.~
@159  = ~[male refugee]I just found them stowed away in my pillow. Surely someone is missing them, and I do not want to be accused of thieving! I know I am lucky to have found shelter in this camp, I will not risk it over some trinkets - especially since I don't know who placed them there.~
@160  = ~[Sir Rayphus]Thanks for your honesty. I will take the gems and look for the rightful owners - as well as the thief who took them.~
@161  = ~[male refugee]Thank you! That takes a huge weight off my shoulders.~
@162  = ~[male refugee]I will go now - I don't want to be around in case the thief comes back and notices the gems are gone...~
@163  = ~[Imoen]But... they were meant for you! And noone here misses them, they belonged to crusaders! Er... I think! I wouldn't *know* of course... uh, but that's what I would *think* happened here.~
@164  = ~[male refugee]That's a rediculous thought - a saint going around and giving treats to the poor refugees? Hmm - I don't think so. I'll definitely hide to make sure the thief won't hassle me!~
@165  = ~[Imoen]Not a saint, but... oh, bummer!~

@173  = ~[Imoen]Aw, but you just didn't want to part with the jewels!~
@174  = ~[Imoen]I think... I think it was wrong to give gems away. Noone seemed really happy to have them...~
@175  = ~You heard Husam - these are probably just the uncontent ones. The other ones are already happily on their way to Baldur's Gate.~
@176  = ~[PC Reply]It's hard to please people - especially everyone.~
@177  = ~[PC Reply]Maybe you are giving the gifts to them wrongly.~
@178  = ~[PC Reply]I am sorry it didn't go as planned. What would you like to do now?~
@179  = ~[PC Reply]Aw, I can't see you like this. How about that - we give whatever gems and trinkets you have left to Sir Rayphus, and he can distribute them to the refugees fairly. Sounds like a plan?~
@180  = ~[PC Reply]You should have given them to me from the start. We'd have a use of them ourselves.~
@181  = ~[PC Reply]I can't be bothered with this, Imoen. They are your gems, do with them what you want.~
@182  = ~[Imoen]Yes, but how else should I do it? I wanted to be all *sneaky* about it! That was part of the thrill...~
@183  = ~[Imoen]Yes, I noticed... (sigh)~
@184  = ~[Imoen]That's a great idea! Then they'll accept them for sure. He can say that they were donated by an unknown donor!~
@185  = ~[Imoen]Yes, I guess you are right... I didn't take any from our shared stack, I swear!~
@186  = ~[Imoen]The thing is... umm... there is still some gems I hid at the tents.~
@187  = ~[PC Reply]What do you suggest?~
@188  = ~[PC Reply]We should go and collect them. Where did you put them?~
@189  = ~[PC Reply]Don't tell me you want *me* to go around and collect them.~
@190  = ~[Imoen]I would like to get them back. Would you come with me?~
@191  = ~[Imoen]And if I say please?~
@192  = ~[PC Reply]Fine - where are they?~
@193  = ~[Imoen]Thanks! Erm... I don't really remember.. but I placed all of them at the right side of the tent entrances. And it was eight stacks, I remember how I counted the gems so they would be equally distributed.~
@194  = ~[PC Reply]Alright, we will search the tents for your gems.~
@195  = ~[PC Reply]You're not serious. Do you expect me to go gem hunting through the whole camp?~
@196  = ~[Imoen]Umm... yes? Pleeease?~
@197  = ~[Imoen]Fiiine... I will just leave the others where they are and not listen to people's complaining. I am *sure* they will do some good.~
@198  = ~[Imoen]Great!~
@199  = ~[Imoen]Well, I do not want to play fairy any more.~
@200  = ~[Imoen]You know what - I'll focus on filling *our* pockets again from now on, and leave the decision about how to spend them to you. Sounds like a plan, no?~
@201  = ~[Imoen]Well, I don't have any now, so I guess it's just a nice throught. Still, it *is* a nice thought!~
@202  = ~[Imoen]I think we have all of them. Phew, what a waste of time.~
@203  = ~[PC Reply]Not exactly. That's a nice sum of gems you collected there.~
@204  = ~[PC Reply]A waste, indeed.~
@205  = ~[Imoen]Well, it's a nice amount of glittering stones, alright!~
@206  = ~[Imoen]Let's bring them to Sir Rayphus like you suggested... before I change my mind!~
@207  = ~[Imoen]Here they are - I'll leave them all with you, like you requested.~
@208  = ~[Imoen]I tell you what, <CHARNAME> - it's the collecting of gems I like doing best. I think I'll focus on finding them for us again, and leave the rest to you!~
@209  = ~[PC Reply]My friend collected these gems from the crusaders, and we thought you could distribute them to refugees who would need the help the most.~
@210  = ~[Sir Rayphus]Oh, what a cheritable donation. I will see to them being given to needing parties accordingly. Have thanks for your generosity.~
@211  = ~[Imoen]Generosity, uh-huh! He meant me with that, you know? I'm a very generous person - today. Now let's go, <CHARNAME> - I need to fill *our* pockets again.~
