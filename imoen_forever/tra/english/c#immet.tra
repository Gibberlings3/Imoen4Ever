@0    = ~<CHARNAME>! They let me go! The Cowled Wizards. After the hearing in the Government Building, I could leave again.~
@1    = ~Imoen! What a relief! I was so worried!~
@2    = ~Well, that was a shock, I can tell you.~
@3    = ~Just like that?~
@4    = ~Ha! Wonderful. I just agreed to pay someone several tens of thousands in gold to get to you out.~
@5    = ~Whatever, Imoen.~
@6    = ~Oh yes. So scary!~
@7    = ~What? Who would offer to help you find me? And yeah, as if we'd have that much to spare!~
@8    = ~I had to pay a penalty of I-don't-know-HOW-much gold so they'd let me go, <CHARNAME>. And you know what? They accepted that stupid girdle I was wearing!~
@9    = ~Yeah, I'm happy to see you too, silly head!~
@10   = ~And *then* I learned that girdle gave me a life boost! I couldn't die while wearing it. Isn't that funny? Irenicus said he gave it to me. Had I known that - had I known that, I would have jumped him and clawed his eyes out instead!~
@11   = ~He... he also put some kind of spell on me. I think it was some kind of a protection spell. It's weird, you know. Being under the protection of the one who tortured us...~
@12   = ~Can I come along again?~
@13   = ~Of course! I'm so happy to see you here I'm still completely speechless!~
@14   = ~Yes, please join again.~
@15   = ~Are you sure you would want to? Being with me only seems to cause you pain.~
@16   = ~I'm sorry, but I'd rather you'd wait a little.~
@17   = ~Oh, I made that decision a long time ago, <CHARNAME>. And it's not you who is hurting me, you know. And the way Irenicus said it... The way he said he'll come for us both - no, I don't think I'd be safer without you, quite the contrary.~
@18   = ~Fine, then I'll wait in that inn over there, at the bar. But don't take too long to come back for me, please!~
@19   = ~Me too. I'm so happy we are together, again! Let's keep it that way from now on, alright?~
@20   = ~I'm so glad to be back!~
//#23458 rephrased
@21   = ~Chapter 2

I escaped from the mad maze that was Irenicus' dungeon only to encounter the wizard, himself, in a battle with assassins in black leather. Perhaps that was why I was able to escape as easily as I did... I don't know. The assassins seemed to be blaming the mage for something, to which Irenicus responded with anger and incredibly powerful magic. Indeed, part of the structure which surrounded him had collapsed from the might of his spells.
As the battle ended, however, Imoen attacked Irenicus, herself... and when strange wizards appeared and put an end to the magical conflict, they took both Imoen and Irenicus away.

Luckily, Imoen returned soon afterwards, unhurt and quite cheerful. Still, I am left in the city of Athkatla in Amn with few allies and enemies that I know nothing about. Irenicus is gone, for now... but threatened to come back for us, once he has set up wherever he is now. And the only place I can go to achieve answers is likely the place he has been taken to.

I have encountered a man named Gaelan Bayle who mysteriously seems to know who I am and sought me out. He has an offer of aid from an equally mysterious source. And one which comes with a very high price, indeed...~

@22   = ~Is-is this your friend, <CHARNAME>? Oh, what a happy reunion! I wished that every rescue mission would take such a happy turn, and after so little time. It is nice to meet you, Imoen! <CHARNAME> was worried sick for you. S-so that means we have more time to explore and go adventuring, before facing your foe!~
@23   = ~Imoen! As much as it pleases me to see you return to us so soon, I do wonder what it will mean in the end. The Cowled Wizards might come back to us for it, or Irenicus could come for us sooner, or... Oh, by Silvanus! It is good to see you, girl.~
@24   = ~Minsc is so happy to see his friend back, and all in one piece! We do not need to go kick evil wizards' butts now, Boo! ...Or maybe yes? We could still go and kick evil wizards' butts, but together with our friend Imoen! Wohoo!~
@25   = ~Minsc is so happy to see his friend back, and all in one piece! We do not need to go kick evil wizards' butts now! ...Or maybe yes? We could still go and kick evil wizards' butts, but together with our friend Imoen! Wohoo!~
@26   = ~This is reason to rejoyce. Yoshimo is sincerely glad to see you back, young friend. Glad as well as surprised, as this Irenicus does not seem like someone to let go of his prey that easily. You need to be wary, <CHARNAME>. Irenicus will have plans for Imoen, as he has for you... At least that is what I assume, after noticing one thing or two while being trapped in his dungeon for some time.~

@27   = ~I think... I think we will be safe from Irenicus... at least for now. Doesn't mean we should become a bunch of lazybones, though, does it?~
