@0  = ~Do you still have my things? Not that I'm that attached to the stuff we found in Irenicus' dungeon, though, but it was better than nothing... I also, er, found some things while the Cowled Wizards removed the belt.~
@1  = ~Imoen! What if they notice the theft and come again?~
@2  = ~Well done, Imoen. This might come in useful.~
@3  = ~(smile) The same old Imoen. I like you this way, you know.~
@4  = ~I forbid you to steal in such situations, Imoen. It might cause trouble we do not need currently.~
@5  = ~Heh. It's impressive what you can find inside a Cowled Wizard's pocket!~
@6  = ~Oh, come on. Don't look at me like that! I am sure it won't be a problem.~
@7  = ~It's not my fault they don't watch their stuff properly, is it?~
