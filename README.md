# Imoen4Ever
This mod aims at making Imoen a steady companion throughout the whole BG-Saga. Imoen-related story content is being considered, therefore Imoen will be out of party temporarily to reflect the most crucial original game events. This mod makes her rejoin the party after such incidents, so that she can be seen as an actual travel companion in SoD (not finished yet) and BGII.

Note: The SoD part is not finished yet.

BGII:
-----------------------------------
This mod gives back Imoen in Chapter 2 and 3, right after the first dialogue with Gaelan. The player can then explore and play all quests without any time pressure or moral dilemma about a friend needing rescue.
The original game content kicks in again after the arrival in Brynnlaw: Imoen will now be kidnapped, and Yoshimo will be available for recruitment in the Brynnlaw tavern.

All(most all) lines referring to Imoen being taken and needing rescue where replaced with references to Irenicus, instead.

SoD:
-----------------------------------
With this tweak, Imoen will remain in your group in the beginning of SoD if she was in BG:EE. She will be a party member in Korlasz's crypt up until the point where all party members leave and the PC finds themselves in the Ducal Palace. From there, Imoen will take her role as in the original game. (Planned: let her rejoin in the first coalition camp.)
Inside Korlasz' Crypt, Imoen will have a PID (player initiated dialogue) out of her original game dialogue. She will talk about Duke Jannath taking an interest in her, but she will only talk about her magic studies if she was already dual-classed to T/M in BG:EE.
After the attack in the Ducal Palace, she will be in no shape to accompany the PC because of the poison. Her "good bye" dialogue the evening before the PC heads out against the crusade is changed with her new motive to stay behind accordingly. 

If Imoen was not in party in the endfight of BG:EE, her presence in Korlasz' Crypt will play like in the original game with no changes. (Planned: but she will rejoin at the first coalition camp.)
