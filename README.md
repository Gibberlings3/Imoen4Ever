# Imoen4Ever
This mod gives back Imoen in Chapter 2 and 3, right after the first dialogue with Gaelan. The player can then explore and play all quests without any time pressure or moral dilemma about a friend needing rescue.
The original game content kicks in again after the arrival in Brynnlaw: Imoen will now be kidnapped, and Yoshimo will be available for recruitment in the Brynnlaw tavern.

All lines referring to Imoen being taken and needing rescue where replaced with references to Irenicus, instead.
